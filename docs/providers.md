# Providers

This guide describes the runtime/provider model introduced by `@aif/runtime`.

## Runtime Architecture

`@aif/runtime` is the shared execution layer for both API and agent packages:

- runtime registry (`RuntimeRegistry`) for built-in and module-loaded adapters
- workflow-spec abstraction (`RuntimeWorkflowSpec`) so orchestrators stay provider-neutral
- runtime-profile resolution (`resolveRuntimeProfile`) with capability checks and redaction helpers
- adapter surfaces for run/resume/session/model-discovery operations

## Runtime Profile Model

Runtime profiles are persisted in `runtime_profiles` and reference only non-secret configuration.

| Field                   | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `projectId`             | Scope profile to one project, or `null` for global profile |
| `name`                  | Display name shown in UI                                   |
| `runtimeId`             | Adapter id (for example `claude`, `codex`)                 |
| `providerId`            | Provider namespace (for example `anthropic`, `openai`)     |
| `transport`             | Adapter transport (`sdk`, `cli`, `api`)                    |
| `baseUrl`               | Optional custom endpoint                                   |
| `apiKeyEnvVar`          | Env var name containing API key                            |
| `defaultModel`          | Optional default model alias/id                            |
| `headers`               | Optional non-secret header map                             |
| `options`               | Adapter-specific options object                            |
| `enabled`               | Toggle profile availability without deleting it            |
| `runtimeLimitSnapshot`  | Latest persisted normalized limit state for this profile   |
| `runtimeLimitUpdatedAt` | ISO timestamp of the last persisted limit-state write      |

Secrets are never written to SQLite. Use environment variables or temporary validation payloads.

## Effective Profile Resolution

Task mode fallback order:

1. `tasks.runtime_profile_id`
2. `projects.default_task_runtime_profile_id`
3. `app_settings.default_task_runtime_profile_id`
4. environment fallback

Planning and review use the same chain, but `default_plan_runtime_profile_id` / `default_review_runtime_profile_id` fall back to the task default at the same scope when unset. Chat uses `default_chat_runtime_profile_id` for the project/app steps.

Scope rules:

- app defaults may point only to enabled global profiles (`runtime_profiles.project_id = null`)
- project defaults and task/chat overrides may point to either a same-project profile or a global profile
- project-owned profiles from another project are rejected at the API layer

The API exposes effective selection endpoints:

- `GET /runtime-profiles/effective/task/:taskId`
- `GET /runtime-profiles/effective/chat/:projectId`

## Supported Runtimes

| Runtime      | Provider     | Transports                | Resume                   | Session Fork     | Sessions             | Agent Defs    | Native Subagents | Isolated Fallback | Usage Reporting                          | Light Model         | Status                    |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `claude`     | `anthropic`  | SDK, CLI, API             | Yes (SDK/CLI)            | Yes (SDK/CLI)    | Yes (SDK/CLI)        | Yes (SDK/CLI) | No               | No                | `FULL` (all transports)                  | `claude-haiku-3-5`  | Built-in                  |
| `codex`      | `openai`     | SDK, CLI, App Server, API | Yes (SDK/CLI/App Server) | Yes (App Server) | Yes (SDK/App Server) | No            | SDK only         | SDK only          | `FULL` SDK/API, `PARTIAL` CLI/App Server | default             | Built-in                  |
| `opencode`   | `opencode`   | API                       | Yes                      | No               | Yes                  | No            | No               | No                | `NONE`                                   | null (configurable) | Built-in                  |
| `openrouter` | `openrouter` | API                       | No                       | No               | No                   | No            | No               | No                | `FULL`                                   | null (configurable) | Built-in                  |
| Custom       | Any          | Any                       | Configurable             | Configurable     | Configurable         | Configurable  | Configurable     | Configurable      | Must declare                             | Configurable        | Via `AIF_RUNTIME_MODULES` |

Capabilities are **transport-aware**: the same adapter may expose different capabilities depending on the selected transport. For example, Codex supports resume on SDK/CLI/App Server, session fork only on App Server, and session discovery on SDK/App Server. Use `resolveAdapterCapabilities(adapter, transport)` to get the effective set.

### Model-specific effort discovery

Reasoning effort is model metadata, not a runtime-wide enum. The profile form reads the supported values from the currently selected model:

| Runtime    | Discovery source                             | Profile option         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude     | Agent SDK `supportedModels()`                | `effort`               |
| Codex      | App Server `model/list` reasoning efforts    | `modelReasoningEffort` |
| OpenCode   | Provider model `variants[*].reasoningEffort` | `reasoningEffort`      |
| OpenRouter | `/models` `reasoning.supported_efforts`      | `effort`               |

The rollout is controlled by `AIF_RUNTIME_MODEL_EFFORT_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=false`. While disabled, the profile form and execution paths keep the stable runtime-specific allowlists. When enabled, adapters normalize and deduplicate provider-advertised values, a model with `supportsEffort: false` hides the control, and execution validates the persisted value against cached metadata for the selected model. If metadata is unavailable, execution retains the runtime-specific fallback allowlist. Stale or unsupported profile values are ignored with a structured warning before any provider request is built.

OpenRouter reports `reasoning.supported_efforts: null` when a model accepts every gateway effort value. In discovery mode this expands to `max`, `xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `minimal`, and `none`; the flag-off fallback remains unchanged.

### Runtime Proxy Support

All built-in runtime adapters understand `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` plus lowercase variants. SDK/CLI/App Server transports receive these variables in their curated child-process environment. API transports use an undici dispatcher directly, so native Node `fetch` does not silently bypass the configured proxy.

Use `ALL_PROXY=socks5://...` for SOCKS5 proxies, and keep `NO_PROXY` populated for local endpoints (`localhost,127.0.0.1,::1`) and Docker service names (`api,agent,web,mcp`).

### Runtime-limit observability

Runtime-limit auto-pause depends on what each provider/transport can actually surface. The runtime layer normalizes these inputs into the shared `runtimeLimitSnapshot` contract and marks each snapshot as either `exact` or `heuristic`.

| Runtime / transport          | Limit source                            | Precision   | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude SDK / CLI             | Claude `rate_limit_event`               | `heuristic` | Structured qualitative status with reset timestamps (`status`, `resetsAt`, `overageStatus`, `isUsingOverage`, ...)                                                                                            |
| Claude API                   | Anthropic rate-limit headers            | `exact`     | Exact request/token limits and reset times from `anthropic-ratelimit-*` + `retry-after`                                                                                                                       |
| Codex API                    | OpenAI-compatible rate-limit headers    | `exact`     | Exact request/token limits and reset times from `x-ratelimit-*` + `retry-after`                                                                                                                               |
| Codex SDK / CLI / App Server | Codex session `token_count.rate_limits` | `exact`     | API background indexing tails persisted Codex session logs into SQLite (`codex_limit_heads`/`codex_limit_history`); `/runtime-profiles` overlays read from that index instead of per-request filesystem scans |
| OpenRouter API               | OpenAI-compatible rate-limit headers    | `exact`     | Uses `x-ratelimit-*` / `retry-after` when the upstream provides them                                                                                                                                          |
| OpenCode API                 | structured error metadata               | `heuristic` | Preserves `resetAt` / retry hints on rate-limit errors, but no proactive normalized snapshot is emitted today                                                                                                 |

Auto-pause semantics follow the precision:

- `exact` snapshots can proactively gate new work when the remaining quota has already crossed the configured safety threshold.
- `heuristic` snapshots only proactively gate when the provider reports the runtime as blocked.
- When a provider exposes `resetAt` / `retryAfterSeconds`, the agent uses those values instead of random quota backoff.

### Provider metadata sanitization

Runtime-limit `providerMeta` is sanitized before it is persisted or exposed outside the runtime layer.

- Only provider-specific allow-listed top-level keys survive sanitization.
- String values are redacted before storage.
- Nested structured objects stay typed only when the key is registered in `PROVIDER_META_NESTED_SCHEMAS` (currently `modelUsageSummary` and `toolUsageSummary`).
- Any new allow-listed key that emits a nested object/array must add a schema entry, otherwise that nested container is collapsed to a redacted opaque JSON string.

Redaction helpers have distinct contracts:

- `redactProviderText()` is the strict client-safe helper. Use it for anything returned to clients or persisted in user-visible payloads.
- `redactProviderTextForLogs()` is the server-log helper. It still scrubs secrets, but preserves URLs and emails so diagnostics remain useful.

For Claude-family profiles, the runtime now distinguishes the backend by resolved endpoint identity, not just `runtimeId/providerId/model`:

- Native Anthropic uses SDK `rate_limit_event` (SDK/CLI) or Anthropic headers (API).
- Z.AI / GLM Coding Plan is detected from Anthropic-compatible endpoints such as `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` and refreshes quota from the provider monitor endpoints when headers are insufficient:
  - `/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit` for live quota windows
  - `/api/monitor/usage/model-usage` for recent model/token usage summaries
  - `/api/monitor/usage/tool-usage` for recent MCP/tool usage summaries
- Alibaba Coding Plan Anthropic-compatible endpoints are tracked as a separate family, but remain `partial` for quota visibility because no official provider-side polling API is integrated yet.
- Other Anthropic-compatible endpoints fall back to headers for API transport and SDK events for SDK/CLI transport when available.

UI grouping for Claude runtime usage should use the normalized backend family plus the server-side account fingerprint (derived from endpoint origin + resolved auth secret), so native Anthropic, Z.AI GLM, and other compatible backends do not collapse into one card.

### Usage reporting contract

Every adapter must declare a `usageReporting` value in its `RuntimeCapabilities`. The registry wrapper reads this field for every run and enforces the contract — a new adapter cannot silently skip token accounting:

- **`FULL`** — adapter always populates `RuntimeRunResult.usage` on a successful run. If the wrapper observes a null `usage` while the capability says `FULL`, it logs an error (dev) or fires a metric (prod). The contract test in `bootstrap.test.ts` also fails the build if the field is missing.
- **`PARTIAL`** — adapter returns usage when the provider gives it, but may return `null` on some transport/streaming paths (e.g. CLI early-termination). The wrapper accepts both and records only the non-null events.
- **`NONE`** — transport fundamentally cannot report token counts (e.g. OpenCode message payload). The wrapper warns if usage unexpectedly appears, but this is an opt-out from the usage pipeline — dashboards will show zero traffic for runtimes in this tier.

All successful runs that produce non-null usage flow through the registry's `usageSink`, which persists them to the `usage_events` table and rolls them up into per-task / per-project / per-chat-session aggregates. Sink wiring lives in `packages/api/src/services/runtime.ts` (API) and `packages/agent/src/index.ts` / `subagentQuery.ts` (agent) — both use `createDbUsageSink()` from `@aif/data`.

### Interactive questions capability

Optional `supportsInteractiveQuestions` flag in `RuntimeCapabilities` declares that the adapter emits runtime-neutral `tool:question` events (e.g. Claude's `AskUserQuestion`). Consumers — notably the chat route — use this flag to gate provider-specific prompt scaffolding (`CHAT_ASKUSERQUESTION_HINT` is only injected into `systemPromptAppend` when the resolved adapter declares the capability). Claude (SDK + CLI) sets the flag; Claude API, Codex, OpenCode, and OpenRouter leave it unset (defaults to `false`). Adapters that add interactive tool parsing must also call `buildToolUseEvents()` with a `questionPayload` so the rendered shape stays identical across runtimes.

### Transport Types

| Transport    | Description                                           | Example                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `sdk`        | In-process library call via JS/TS SDK                 | Claude Agent SDK, Codex SDK              |
| `cli`        | Spawn a subprocess, parse stdout                      | `claude --agent ...`, `codex run --json` |
| `app-server` | Spawn `codex app-server` and exchange stdio JSONL RPC | Codex App Server transport               |
| `api`        | HTTP POST to a remote endpoint                        | OpenAI-compatible REST API               |

#### Transport Observability Differences

**SDK transport** streams events in real time — tool calls, subagent spawns, and partial messages are visible as they happen. The Agent Activity timeline shows each tool invocation with timestamps. The first-activity watchdog can detect hung agents within 60 seconds.

**CLI and API transports** are opaque — the entire tool-calling cycle runs inside the subprocess or remote server. The coordinator only sees "agent started" and "agent complete/failed" with no intermediate events. Consequently:

- **Agent Activity** shows only start/complete entries, not individual tool calls
- **First-activity watchdog** is disabled (no `onToolUse` callbacks to monitor)
- **Start timeout** (`AGENT_QUERY_START_TIMEOUT_MS`) is disabled — CLI/API produce output only after the full run completes, so the only protection is the run timeout (`AGENT_STAGE_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- **Token usage** is reported as a single aggregate at the end of the run

**Codex App Server transport** streams JSONL notifications from the subprocess, so it behaves closer to SDK from an observability perspective (streaming events, resumable thread IDs) while still using a local process execution model.

## Built-In Adapter Examples

### Claude (SDK)

```json
{
  "projectId": "PROJECT_UUID",
  "name": "Claude Sonnet",
  "runtimeId": "claude",
  "providerId": "anthropic",
  "transport": "sdk",
  "apiKeyEnvVar": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  "defaultModel": "sonnet",
  "enabled": true
}
```

Optional proxy mode:

- set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
- set one of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
- if proxy requires explicit model, set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (or profile `defaultModel`)
- if proxy handles model routing, keep `defaultModel` empty

> **Attribution suppression:** the adapter forwards `settings.attribution = { commit: "", pr: "" }` — empty strings hide the Co-Authored-By trailers, per Claude Code's documented contract. These empty strings are forwarded verbatim (not normalized away); collapsing them to `{}` would restore Claude Code's default attribution.

**Minimum Claude Code version: `2.1.191`.** Older builds reject empty attribution strings at startup and the spawned `claude` exits with code 1 and no stderr, which surfaces as the opaque `Claude Code process exited with code 1`. Before every **SDK/API run and before model discovery** the adapter checks the version of the **exact binary `query()` will launch** and fails fast with an actionable `CLAUDE_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` (category `transport`) error when it is below `2.1.191`, instead of failing opaquely inside the Agent SDK. The check never inspects an unrelated `claude` on `PATH`: when an explicit executable is configured it spawns `<path> --version`; when none is configured it reads the version of the Claude Code binary **bundled with `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`** from that package's `manifest.json` (the precise artifact the SDK launches — no spawn, no PATH/musl ambiguity). If that version cannot be determined, the check is skipped with a warning and the run proceeds — the real failure, if any, is then explained by the runtime diagnostics.

> **Scope of the guard: SDK/API + model discovery only.** The version guard covers the SDK and API transports (the `/chat` default) and model discovery. It does **not** cover the **CLI transport** — the CLI spawns `claude` synchronously and the guard's pre-spawn probe is not wired into that path, so an old CLI binary can still surface `exited with code 1`. Pin a current CLI via `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` (Docker) or `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest` (≥ 2.1.191) for CLI-transport profiles.

**Compatible by construction.** The runtime depends on `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `0.3.220`, whose bundled native Claude Code binary is `2.1.220` (declared in its `manifest.json`) — at/above the `2.1.191` minimum — so the default SDK path accepts the empty attribution strings without further setup.

**Effective executable selection.** The SDK transport launches the binary bundled with `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` by default (the Agent SDK resolves its own per-platform native binary; Handoff does not point it at a global install). An explicit override — `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` via `execution.hooks`, or the adapter constructor's `executablePath` — makes the SDK launch and the guard inspect that exact path instead. (Note: the per-profile `claudeCliPath` option is honored by the **CLI transport** and by **model discovery**, not by the main SDK run path.) `normalizeSdkExecutablePath()` drops bare Unix wrapper paths unless they were explicitly configured. The Docker image additionally installs a global `claude` pinned via the `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` build arg (`2.1.220` by default; override with `--build-arg CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=...`) for the CLI transport and connection/diagnostic probes. To bypass the runtime check, set `AIF_CLAUDE_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`.

### Claude (CLI)

Spawns `claude` binary as a subprocess. Supports `--agent` flag for agent definitions and `--resume` for session continuation. Auth is handled by the CLI's own login (`claude /login`).

```json
{
  "projectId": null,
  "name": "Claude CLI",
  "runtimeId": "claude",
  "providerId": "anthropic",
  "transport": "cli",
  "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "enabled": true
}
```

CLI-specific options:

- `claudeCliPath` — override for the `claude` binary path (default: auto-discovered)
- `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` env var — same, via environment
- `environment` — per-profile environment variables injected into the spawned `claude` subprocess. Useful for pinning `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so different projects run under different `~/.claude/` home directories (multi-account setups). Values must be strings; non-string entries are silently dropped. Per-call `execution.environment` overrides take precedence over profile-level values.

Multi-account example — one profile per Claude login:

```json
{
  "name": "Claude CLI (personal)",
  "runtimeId": "claude",
  "providerId": "anthropic",
  "transport": "cli",
  "options": {
    "environment": { "CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR": "/Users/me/.claude-personal" }
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Claude CLI (work)",
  "runtimeId": "claude",
  "providerId": "anthropic",
  "transport": "cli",
  "options": {
    "environment": { "CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR": "/Users/me/.claude-work" }
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

Assign each profile as the default task runtime for a different Handoff project (project settings → runtime profile). Subagents spawned for that project then read credentials, plugins, and history from the matching `~/.claude-*/` directory instead of the shared host `~/.claude/`.

> The same field is honored on the SDK transport via `parseExecutionOptions`, but `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` only affects subprocess-style invocations. For SDK transport, pass per-account `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` via `apiKeyEnvVar` instead.

### Codex (SDK transport)

Uses `@openai/codex-sdk` which wraps the installed Codex CLI with thread-based conversations, streaming events, and resume support. Auth is handled by the CLI's own login (`codex auth login`), same as Claude SDK. The executable is resolved as `options.codexCliPath`, then `CODEX_CLI_PATH`, then `codex` from `PATH`; Handoff does not fall back to the SDK's vendored Codex binary.

```json
{
  "projectId": null,
  "name": "Codex SDK",
  "runtimeId": "codex",
  "providerId": "openai",
  "transport": "sdk",
  "defaultModel": "gpt-5.4",
  "enabled": true
}
```

SDK-specific options:

- `codexCliPath` — path to the installed `codex` binary (SDK wraps the CLI); overrides `CODEX_CLI_PATH`
- `codexConfig` — JSON object of CLI config overrides (flattened to `--config` flags)
- `sandboxMode` — one of `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`
- `approvalPolicy` — one of `untrusted`, `on-failure`, `on-request`, `never`
- `modelReasoningEffort` — a reasoning effort advertised by the selected model; the UI discovers the available values at runtime
- `codexSubagentStrategy` — `native` or `isolated`; native Codex subagents are additionally gated by `AIF_RUNTIME_CODEX_NATIVE_SUBAGENTS_ENABLED=true` and required `.codex` assets on disk. Leave unset or use `isolated` to keep the legacy fresh-session skill workflow.
- `skipGitRepoCheck` — bypass the Codex guard that refuses to run outside a git repo (SDK, App Server, and CLI)

> Migration note: native Codex subagents are off by default until operators opt in with `AIF_RUNTIME_CODEX_NATIVE_SUBAGENTS_ENABLED=true`.
> If the flag is disabled, Handoff falls back to the isolated skill-session path even when `codexSubagentStrategy: "native"` is configured.
> If the project was bootstrapped before the AI Factory release containing `ai-factory#70`, Handoff checks for materialized `.codex/agents/*.toml` and `.codex/config.toml` before using the native path and automatically falls back to `isolated` until AI Factory is upgraded and `ai-factory init --agents claude,codex` is re-run.

Invalid `options.approvalPolicy` / `options.sandboxMode` values are ignored with a runtime warning, and the adapter falls back to the effective default for that execution path.

### Codex (CLI transport)

```json
{
  "projectId": null,

> **Auth (local Codex transports — SDK / CLI / App Server).** These default to local `codex login` / OAuth. They do **not** implicitly consume an ambient `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, so a placeholder key in `.env` cannot hijack an OAuth-backed session. The `apiKeyEnvVar` in the example above is the explicit opt-in: set it (or `options.apiKey`) only when you want the local transport to authenticate with an API key. Omit it to use OAuth. The **API transport** is unchanged and still uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

> **OpenAI-compatible gateways (e.g. router.ai) via CLI.** The Codex CLI reads its endpoint from `~/.codex/config.toml` (`model_providers.<name>.base_url`) and **ignores** `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `CODEX_BASE_URL` env vars (they are blocked/deprecated by the CLI). To point the CLI at a custom gateway the provider must speak the **Responses API** (`POST /v1/responses`; the CLI uses it via WebSocket and fails with `403 wss://api.openai.com/v1/responses` against REST-only gateways). The adapter **auto-provisions** this config on every CLI run (`ensureCodexProviderConfig` in `packages/runtime/src/adapters/codex/config.ts`): it writes `[model_providers.<host>]` with `base_url` from the profile `baseUrl`, `env_key` from `apiKeyEnvVar`, `wire_api = "responses"`, and sets `model_provider = "<host>"` — preserving any existing `config.toml` (MCP servers, project trust). No manual setup is needed; the profile `baseUrl` alone is sufficient.

**`codexCliArgs` is a full escape hatch.** When `options.codexCliArgs` is set, the adapter uses the custom template verbatim (with `{prompt}`, `{model}`, `{session_id}` substitutions) and **skips all adapter-managed flags** — including `--model`, `-c model_reasoning_effort`, `-c approval_policy`, `-c sandbox_mode`, `--skip-git-repo-check`, and the bypass-permission translation. If you use a custom template you are responsible for emitting these flags yourself. Profile-level `options.approvalPolicy`, `options.sandboxMode`, `options.skipGitRepoCheck`, `options.modelReasoningEffort`, and `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS` all have **no effect** when a custom template is active. Use this only for integration with non-standard CLI wrappers.

### Codex (App Server transport)

Runs `codex app-server` over stdio JSONL RPC and keeps Codex thread IDs as resumable runtime session IDs.

```json
{
  "projectId": null,
  "name": "Codex App Server",
  "runtimeId": "codex",
  "providerId": "openai",
  "transport": "app-server",
  "defaultModel": "gpt-5.4",
  "options": {
    "approvalPolicy": "on-request",
    "sandboxMode": "workspace-write"
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

App Server operational notes:

- Reuses the same key options as other Codex transports: `codexCliPath`, `approvalPolicy`, `sandboxMode`, `modelReasoningEffort`, and `skipGitRepoCheck`.
- Uses the installed Codex CLI only: `options.codexCliPath`, then `CODEX_CLI_PATH`, then `codex` from `PATH`.
- Does not add a transport-local hard run timeout. Long-running stages are governed by the shared runtime execution config; `options.appServerRequestTimeoutMs` only controls individual JSONL RPC request waits.
- Human approval bridging is not implemented yet. App Server approval requests, including command, file-change, permissions, apply-patch, and exec-command requests, are denied by design and surfaced as permission failures/events; App Server therefore reports `supportsApprovals: false` even though approval request events are observable. Unattended App Server profiles should use `approvalPolicy="never"` only when the caller has intentionally accepted that trust level.
- Session list APIs are supported through `thread/list` and `thread/read`; AIF stores Codex thread IDs as runtime session IDs for resume.
- Docker images resolve the Codex SDK and its matching CLI during image build using `CODEX_VERSION` (`0.145.0` by default, with npm dist-tags, exact versions, and semver ranges supported as explicit overrides). The bundled executable is placed on `PATH` and selected through `CODEX_CLI_PATH`; containers mount persistent `~/.codex` auth state (`codex-auth` volume).
- On Windows, configured `codexCliPath` / `CODEX_CLI_PATH` values are treated as executable paths or shim names, not shell snippets. Values containing command-shell metacharacters are rejected before spawn.

### Codex (API transport)

```json
{
  "projectId": "PROJECT_UUID",
  "name": "Codex API",
  "runtimeId": "codex",
  "providerId": "openai",
  "transport": "api",
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
  "apiKeyEnvVar": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Codex OAuth login in Docker (broker)

`codex login --device-auth` (codex-cli v0.124.0+) prints a fixed verification
URL plus a one-time code. The user opens the URL in the host browser, enters
the code, completes ChatGPT sign-in — the CLI exits 0 and writes
`~/.codex/auth.json` inside the container. No loopback callback, no port
binding, no host bridging.

The agent ships a small HTTP broker (`packages/agent/src/codex/loginBroker.ts`)
that wraps this flow when `AIF_ENABLE_CODEX_LOGIN_PROXY=true`:

```
[API /auth/codex/login/*]
  ▼ proxies over docker network
[Agent :3010 broker]
  ├─ start  → spawn `codex login --device-auth`,
  │           parse stdout for verification URL + code,
  │           expose them on /status
  ├─ status → { active, sessionId, verificationUrl, userCode, startedAt }
  └─ cancel → SIGTERM child
```

The CLI exits naturally when the user finishes the browser flow; the broker
clears the active session on the child `exit` event and `/status` flips to
`{ active: false }`. The web UI polls `/status` to detect completion.

**Endpoints** (api-side, all behind the feature flag):

| Method | Path                       | Purpose                                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/auth/codex/capabilities` | Always mounted. Returns `{loginProxyEnabled}`.                  |
| POST   | `/auth/codex/login/start`  | Spawn the CLI, return `{verificationUrl, userCode, ...}`.       |
| POST   | `/auth/codex/login/cancel` | SIGTERM the active child process.                               |
| GET    | `/auth/codex/login/status` | Poll for active/inactive + the current code + verification URL. |

**Security:**

- One-shot session: repeat `start` without `cancel`/success → `409 session_already_active`.
- Broker binds `0.0.0.0:3010` but is **not** port-mapped to the host in compose; only services on the same docker network can reach it.
- Logs mask all but the last 2 characters of the one-time code (`maskUserCode`).
- No user-supplied URL is ever forwarded — there is no callback endpoint to abuse.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable                       | Default             | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `AIF_ENABLE_CODEX_LOGIN_PROXY` | `false`             | Enable broker + `/auth/codex/*` routes.          |
| `AIF_CODEX_LOGIN_BROKER_PORT`  | `3010`              | Port the broker listens on inside the container. |
| `AGENT_INTERNAL_URL`           | `http://agent:3010` | Base URL the api uses to reach the broker.       |

**Production guidance:** the broker is a dev-only convenience. In production,
set `AIF_ENABLE_CODEX_LOGIN_PROXY=false` (the default in `docker-compose.production.yml`)
and provision `OPENAI_API_KEY` via `.env` instead.

### Bypass semantics (AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS)

When `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=1` is set in the environment, the runtime layer flips `execution.bypassPermissions=true`. This is intended for trusted, externally sandboxed environments (Docker containers) where the agent should run unattended.

Each adapter translates this to its native "trust me, just run" mechanism:

| Runtime / transport | Bypass translation                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude SDK          | `permissionMode="bypassPermissions"` + `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions=true`                               |
| Claude CLI          | `--dangerously-skip-permissions`                                                                            |
| Codex SDK           | `approvalPolicy="never"` + `sandboxMode="danger-full-access"` (ThreadOptions)                               |
| Codex App Server    | `approvalPolicy="never"` + `sandboxMode="danger-full-access"` (thread metadata + interrupt-aware turn flow) |
| Codex CLI           | `-c approval_policy="never" -c sandbox_mode="danger-full-access"`                                           |

Why Codex disables both approval prompts **and** the sandbox: Codex has two orthogonal safety rails (approval policy + OS-level sandbox), while Claude has only one (permission prompts). To match Claude's effective "agent can do anything" behavior, both rails must be cleared. Leaving the Codex sandbox at its default `workspace-write` blocks network access — so `npm install`, `curl`, `git push`, and WebFetch would silently fail.

The Codex CLI uses `--config` (`-c`) overrides instead of the single `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag because the same code path must work for both `codex exec` and `codex exec resume` — the resume subcommand rejects the standalone `--sandbox` flag, while `--config` overrides are accepted on both. The end-state is identical to the atomic flag.

**Opting out for Codex:** if you want narrower safety even in bypass mode, set `options.sandboxMode` or `options.approvalPolicy` explicitly in your profile — explicit profile values override the bypass defaults on SDK, App Server, and CLI transports:

```json
{
  "runtimeId": "codex",
  "transport": "cli",
  "options": {
    "sandboxMode": "workspace-write",
    "approvalPolicy": "never"
  }
}
```

With the example above, even when `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=1` is set, the agent runs with `approval_policy=never` (from the explicit option, which happens to coincide with the bypass default) and `sandbox_mode=workspace-write` (overrides the `danger-full-access` bypass default). You can mix and match — only the axis you set gets overridden.

### OpenRouter (API)

OpenRouter is a unified API proxy providing access to 200+ models from multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.) through a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```json
{
  "projectId": "PROJECT_UUID",
  "name": "OpenRouter",
  "runtimeId": "openrouter",
  "providerId": "openrouter",
  "transport": "api",
  "apiKeyEnvVar": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
  "defaultModel": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "enabled": true
}
```

OpenRouter-specific options:

- `httpReferer` — URL of your app, used for OpenRouter rankings and rate limit priority
- `appTitle` — app name shown in OpenRouter dashboard (defaults to `AIF Handoff`)
- `baseUrl` — custom endpoint (defaults to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`)
- `effort` — a reasoning effort advertised for the selected model by the `/models` response

Environment variables:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — API key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` — custom endpoint (for self-hosted proxies)
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL` — default model when profile `defaultModel` is not set
- `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER` — recommended referer header for rankings
- `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` — recommended app title header for rankings

Model IDs use the `provider/model` format (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`). Some models are available for free (suffixed with `:free`).

### OpenCode (API)

OpenCode integration uses the local or remote `opencode serve` HTTP server. This is the recommended mode for `@aif/runtime` because it provides session APIs and event streams through a stable OpenAPI surface.

```json
{
  "projectId": "PROJECT_UUID",
  "name": "OpenCode API",
  "runtimeId": "opencode",
  "providerId": "opencode",
  "transport": "api",
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4096",
  "defaultModel": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "enabled": true
}
```

OpenCode-specific options:

- `baseUrl` — OpenCode server URL (defaults to `OPENCODE_BASE_URL` or `http://127.0.0.1:4096`)
- `serverUsername` — Basic auth username for protected servers (defaults to `opencode`)
- `serverPassword` — Basic auth password for protected servers (or set `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`)
- `timeoutMs` — Request timeout override for OpenCode API calls
- `reasoningEffort` — a value derived from the selected model's OpenCode variants

Environment variables:

- `OPENCODE_BASE_URL` — default OpenCode server URL for API transport
- `OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME` — default username for basic auth
- `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` — password for basic auth protected servers
- `OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ID` — default provider ID when runtime profile model does not include `provider/model`

Quick start:

```bash
opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4096
```

For Dockerized deployments, expose the OpenCode server and set profile `baseUrl` to the container/network address.

Permission handling:

- OpenCode permissions live in the server-side `opencode.json` config (per-agent `permission` map resolving to `"allow"` / `"ask"` / `"deny"`). The default `build` agent is effectively permissive (`"*": "allow"` with a few exceptions).
- When `AGENT_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=true`, the adapter forces `agent: "build"` in the message body so a user-configured restrictive `default_agent` (e.g. `plan`) cannot block edits.
- Per-tool `"ask"` rules (e.g. reading `.env*`, writing outside the worktree) are still enforced server-side. If a session hits an `"ask"` rule, OpenCode emits a permission event over `/event` SSE that no-one answers, and the `/session/:id/message` POST will hang until `runTimeoutMs`. For full parity with Claude's `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, set `"permission": "allow"` in `opencode.json`.

## Capability Gates

Runtime descriptors declare capability flags:

- `supportsResume`
- `supportsSessionFork`
- `supportsSessionList`
- `supportsAgentDefinitions`
- `supportsStreaming`
- `supportsModelDiscovery`
- `supportsApprovals`
- `supportsCustomEndpoint`
- `supportsNativeSubagentWorkflows`
- `supportsIsolatedSubagentWorkflows`

`supportsSessionFork` gates adapters that can create a child session from a reusable source session. Warmup flows use this capability and must call the optional `forkSession()` method instead of resuming the source session directly. The capability is also behind the off-by-default `AIF_RUNTIME_SESSION_FORK_ENABLED=false` rollout flag; fork-capable transports expose `supportsSessionFork=true` only when that flag is enabled.

Additionally, `RuntimeExecutionIntent` supports `outputSchema` for structured JSON output (passed to adapters that support it, e.g. Codex SDK).

Workflows with unsupported requirements are rejected with normalized validation errors instead of raw adapter exceptions.

### Transport-Aware Capabilities

Adapters that support multiple transports may implement `getEffectiveCapabilities(transport)` to declare per-transport capability sets. The system uses `resolveAdapterCapabilities(adapter, transport)` to query the effective capabilities before checking workflow requirements.

## Runtime Profile API

Runtime profile management routes:

- `GET /runtime-profiles/runtimes`
- `GET /runtime-profiles`
- `POST /runtime-profiles`
- `PUT /runtime-profiles/:id`
- `DELETE /runtime-profiles/:id`
- `POST /runtime-profiles/validate`
- `POST /runtime-profiles/models`

Use `validate` before enabling new profiles, especially when using custom endpoints or transport-specific options.

## External Runtime Modules

Set `AIF_RUNTIME_MODULES` to a comma-separated list of module specifiers. Each module must export `registerRuntimeModule(registry)`.

Minimal module shape:

```ts
import { UsageReporting, type RuntimeAdapter } from "@aif/runtime";

const adapter: RuntimeAdapter = {
  descriptor: {
    id: "my-runtime",
    providerId: "my-provider",
    displayName: "My Runtime",
    capabilities: {
      supportsResume: false,
      supportsSessionFork: false,
      supportsSessionList: false,
      supportsAgentDefinitions: false,
      supportsStreaming: true,
      supportsModelDiscovery: true,
      supportsApprovals: false,
      supportsCustomEndpoint: true,
      supportsIsolatedSubagentWorkflows: false,
      supportsNativeSubagentWorkflows: false,
      usageReporting: UsageReporting.NONE,
    },
  },
  async run(input) {
    return { outputText: "ok", sessionId: null, usage: null };
  },
};

export function registerRuntimeModule(registry: {
  registerRuntime: (adapter: RuntimeAdapter) => void;
}) {
  registry.registerRuntime(adapter, { source: "module" });
}
```

Supported export forms:

- named export `registerRuntimeModule`
- default export function
- default export object containing `registerRuntimeModule`

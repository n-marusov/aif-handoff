# Architecture

## Overview

AIF Handoff is a Turborepo monorepo with seven packages. The system automates task management: a React Kanban UI lets users create tasks, the API and agent operate through a centralized data layer backed by SQLite, and runtime execution goes through `@aif/runtime` so orchestration is provider-neutral.

## Packages

| Package            | Name           | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/shared`  | `@aif/shared`  | Types, schema, state machine, constants, env, logger          |

### Dependency Graph

```
shared ← data
shared ← runtime
runtime ← api
runtime ← agent
shared ← web (browser export only)
data   ← api
data   ← agent
data   ← mcp
```

No cross-dependencies between `api`, `web`, and `agent`. Runtime integration is:

- `web` ↔ `api` via HTTP/WebSocket
- `agent`/`api` → `@aif/runtime` for run/resume/session/model-discovery flows
- `api`/`agent` → SQLite via `@aif/data`
- `agent` → `api` via HTTP for best-effort broadcast notifications
- Lint guard enforces this boundary: `api` and `agent` cannot import DB helpers from `@aif/shared` or SQL builders directly.

## Runtime Registry and Profile Resolution

Runtime execution is centralized in `packages/runtime`:

- `registry.ts` registers built-in adapters and optional external modules (`AIF_RUNTIME_MODULES`).
- `workflowSpec.ts` defines runtime-independent execution intent (`planner`, `implementer`, `reviewer`, one-shot API flows).
- `resolution.ts` merges profile data + env secrets + model/runtime overrides with capability checks.

Effective task profile selection order is:

1. Task override (`tasks.runtime_profile_id`)
2. Project default (`projects.default_task_runtime_profile_id`)
3. System default (optional runtime bootstrap configuration)

The same pattern applies to chat mode using `default_chat_runtime_profile_id`.

### Runtime-Limit Snapshots and Auto-Pause

Runtime-limit state is normalized once in `@aif/runtime` and then persisted in SQLite so every process sees the same view:

- adapters translate provider-specific quota signals into a shared `runtimeLimitSnapshot` contract;
- `runtime_profiles.runtime_limit_snapshot_json` stores the latest authoritative profile-level state;
- `tasks.runtime_limit_snapshot_json` stores a task-level copy when work is blocked by quota pressure or hard exhaustion.
- API runs a background Codex indexer that reconciles `~/.codex/sessions` into SQLite read-model tables (`codex_sessions`, `codex_limit_heads`, `codex_limit_history`, `codex_index_cursors`) so hot endpoints (`/chat/sessions`, `/runtime-profiles`) use DB reads instead of request-path filesystem scans.

The source is explicit in the snapshot (`provider_api`, `sdk_event`, `api_headers`, `turn_usage`) so upper layers do not need adapter-specific branching.

The coordinator treats persisted profile state as authoritative:

- exact snapshots can proactively gate new work when the configured safety threshold has already been crossed;
- heuristic snapshots can proactively gate new work when the provider says the runtime is blocked;
- blocked tasks resume through the existing `blocked_external` + `retryAfter` release path when the provider reset time arrives.

Short-lived in-memory caches exist only for dedupe/throttling repeated identical writes; they are not the source of truth.

## Agent Pipeline

The coordinator (`packages/agent/src/coordinator.ts`) uses a dual-trigger model: it polls via `node-cron` every 30 seconds as a fallback and also reacts to real-time events from the API WebSocket (task creation, moves, and explicit `agent:wake` signals). Duplicate wakes are debounced, and both trigger sources share a single-flight poll loop; a trigger received during an active cycle requests one coalesced follow-up cycle. If the WebSocket is unavailable, the coordinator falls back to polling-only mode.

The coordinator supports **parallel task execution** (experimental, per-project). It first selects up to `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_PROJECTS` (default 4) independent project lanes and runs those lanes concurrently, while `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` (default 12) remains a global safety ceiling across all lanes. A FIFO permit governor distributes global capacity across runnable lanes and waits for released slots instead of dropping later selected lanes. Within one lane, pipeline stages still drain sequentially to preserve project-local ordering. When a project has "Parallel Execution" enabled in settings, up to `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS_PER_PROJECT` (default 3) tasks per stage run concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`; non-parallel projects always process 1 task at a time. Tasks are atomically claimed (`lockedBy`/`lockedUntil` columns) with lock duration tied to the stage timeout; heartbeats renew the lock periodically. Stale claims (expired TTL or dead heartbeat) are auto-released. On shutdown, active locks are released immediately.

It delegates workflow stages to `.claude/agents/` definitions, but actual execution transport/model/session behavior is adapter-owned through `@aif/runtime`:

Skills-mode tasks (`useSubagents=false`) can opt into two extra stages:

Planning ──[runPlanImprove]──► Improve ──► Plan Ready
Implementing ──[runPostVerify]──► Verify ──► Review

### GitHub Issue-to-PR Workflow

The entire workflow is guarded by the off-by-default `AIF_GITHUB_ISSUE_PR_ENABLED` rollout
flag. When disabled, the API, UI, planner, and coordinator preserve legacy behavior and make
no GitHub calls or GitHub-specific Git mutations.

One optional GitHub repository connection belongs to a project. The API periodically reads
eligible issues and atomically maps `(project_id, issue_number)` to one full-mode task. Issue
title, body, labels, assignees, milestone, comments, state, and source timestamps remain a
refreshable snapshot; the task description is read-only in the UI.

```text
GitHub issue → sync/dedupe → task → isolated worktree/branch → commit + push
      ↑                                                        │
      └── changes requested ← same task/PR ← automated review ← PR publish/update
                                                               │
                                     human merge → Done → Verified
```

GitHub tasks always use a persisted per-task worktree when Git supports it, independent of
the general parallel-worktree rollout flag. The agent never embeds a token in Git commands:
push uses configured Git credentials, while PR operations go through the authenticated
internal API. PR creation tolerates restart races by looking up the branch after GitHub's
duplicate-validation response, and review comments are fingerprinted to avoid duplicates.

`Done` is the terminal **PR ready for human decision** state in this mode. The coordinator
never merges and the web UI does not offer local approve/request-change actions for these
tasks. During first import, sync detects an open PR with a same-repository
`Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves #<issue>` reference and atomically creates the linked task in
`Done`; an existing changes-requested review sends it to `Implementing` instead. GitHub sync
alone moves a merged PR to `Verified` or resumes the same task and branch at `Implementing`
after a later changes-requested review. Authentication/access failures, rate limits, push
failures, closed issues, closed unmerged PRs, and unavailable API services are surfaced or
paused without creating a second task or PR.

### GitLab Issue-to-MR Workflow

The GitLab mode mirrors the GitHub workflow with `namespace/project` identifiers, issue IIDs,
and merge requests. It is active only when `GIT_PROVIDER=gitlab` **and**
`AIF_GITLAB_ISSUE_MR_ENABLED=true`; the default `GIT_PROVIDER=github` preserves the existing
GitHub behavior unchanged, and only one provider is active per deployment.

One optional GitLab repository connection belongs to a project. The API periodically reads
eligible issues and atomically maps `(project_id, iid)` to one full-mode task using the
GitLab global issue id (`global_id`). Issue title, body, labels, assignees, milestone,
comments, state, and source timestamps remain a refreshable snapshot; the task description
is read-only in the UI.

```text
GitLab issue → sync/dedupe → task → isolated worktree/branch → commit + push
      ↑                                                          │
      └── approval pending ← same task/MR ← automated review ← MR publish/update
                                                                 │
                                       human merge → Done → Verified
```

GitLab tasks use the same persisted per-task worktree and commit-gate machinery as GitHub
tasks. The agent never embeds a token in Git commands: push uses configured Git credentials,
while MR operations go through the authenticated internal API. MR creation tolerates
restart races by looking up the branch after GitLab's duplicate-validation response, and
review notes carry a `<!-- aif-gitlab-review -->` marker updated only when the fingerprint
changes.

`Done` is the terminal **MR ready for human decision** state in this mode. The coordinator
never merges and the web UI does not offer local approve/request-change actions for these
tasks. Review state is approvals-only: `approved` when the MR approvals endpoint reports
`approved=true`, otherwise `pending` — there is no automatic `changes_requested` transition
in v1. A merged MR advances a MR-ready `Done` task to `Verified`; a closed unmerged MR
pauses its task. Authentication/access failures, rate limits, push failures, closed issues,
and unavailable API services are surfaced or paused without creating a second task or MR.

### Reliability Guards

The pipeline includes four reliability layers for long-running autonomous execution:

- **First-activity watchdog (SDK only):** After agent start, if no tool call or subagent spawn arrives within `AGENT_FIRST_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 60s), the agent is killed and restarted (up to 2 retries). Detects hung agents within seconds instead of waiting for the stale timeout. Disabled for CLI/API transports which do not stream tool events.
- **Heartbeat liveness:** Task rows are updated with `lastHeartbeatAt` during agent activity and stage transitions.
- **Stale-stage watchdog:** On each poll cycle, tasks stuck in `planning` / `improve` / `implementing` / `review` / `verify` beyond timeout are auto-recovered to `blocked_external` with retry backoff.
- **Runtime-limit auto-pause:** Exact/heuristic persisted runtime-limit snapshots can proactively move new work to `blocked_external` before a provider hard-fails, and structured `resetAt` / `retryAfterSeconds` replace random quota backoff when available.
- **Transition reset:** valid transitions clear watchdog state (`blocked*`, `retryAfter`, `retryCount`) and refresh heartbeat baseline.

For stale `implementing`, recovery resumes from `plan_ready` to force a clean implementation pass instead of continuing a potentially inconsistent in-flight run.

### Layer-Driven Implementation Dispatch

Before launching `implement-coordinator`, the implementer computes dependency layers from the active plan (`.ai-factory/PLAN.md` or `.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md`) and injects a precomputed execution summary into the prompt.

This makes parallelism explicit:

- layers with one ready task are sequential,
- layers with multiple ready tasks are parallel and must dispatch `implement-worker` subagents.

### Agent Definitions

All agents are defined as markdown files in `.claude/agents/*.md` and loaded by runtimes that support agent definitions (e.g. Claude adapter via `settingSources: ["project"]`). The `agent` package orchestrates _when_ to invoke them; the markdown files define _what_ they do. For runtimes without agent definition support, the prompt policy falls back to slash-command injection.

## Task State Machine

Defined in `packages/shared/src/stateMachine.ts`. Human actions available per status:

| Status             | Human Actions                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backlog`          | `start_ai`                                               |
| `planning`         | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `improve`          | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `plan_ready`       | `start_implementation`, `request_replanning`, `fast_fix` |
| `implementing`     | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `review`           | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `verify`           | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `blocked_external` | `retry_from_blocked`                                     |
| `done`             | `approve_done`, `request_changes`                        |
| `verified`         | _(terminal state)_                                       |

Tasks have an `autoMode` flag. When `true`, the agent automatically transitions through all stages. This includes an automatic post-review gate: reviewer output is stored in a structured format, parsed deterministically, and converted into blocking findings for the next cycle. When blockers remain, the coordinator applies a `request_changes`-style transition (`done -> implementing`) with an agent comment containing required fixes. When `false`, the user must manually trigger `start_implementation` from `plan_ready`.

Auto-review strategy is controlled globally by `AGENT_AUTO_REVIEW_STRATEGY`:

- `full_re_review` (default): every review cycle can trigger another automatic rework if current blocking findings exist.
- `closure_first`: rework cycles verify previously-blocking findings first; only `still_blocking` previous findings can trigger another automatic loop.
- If `closure_first` resolves previous blockers but the reviewer finds new blockers, or if max review iterations are reached, the task moves to `done` with `manualReviewRequired=true` and preserved `autoReviewState` for explicit human triage.

Tasks also have a `skipReview` flag (default `false`). When `true`, the coordinator bypasses the review stage entirely — after successful implementation the task moves directly to `done`, skipping the `review-sidecar` and `security-sidecar` runs. This is useful for small changes or tasks where code review is unnecessary.

Skills-mode tasks (`useSubagents=false`) also have two opt-in flags. `runPlanImprove` inserts `/aif-improve` after the initial plan and before `plan_ready`. This is plan refinement: it may replace the stored plan only when the improver returns a complete plan-shaped update. `runPostVerify` inserts `/aif-verify` after implementation and before review. This is an execution validation gate: it stores verification output, passes through to review/done on pass or warn, and moves to `blocked_external` for a blocking gate result. Both flags default to `false` and are ignored for subagent tasks.

### Participants, Ownership, and Manual Execution

Participants Mode is an off-by-default policy layer around the existing state machine.
The browser authenticates with an opaque local session cookie and session-derived CSRF
token; the API attaches an immutable actor context and computes task permissions from the
same resolver used to apply transitions. WebSocket upgrades use the same session and exact
origin policy. HTTP MCP uses a separate bearer token and cannot mutate ownership.

```text
browser cookie + Origin + CSRF
              │
              ▼
API auth/RBAC ──► @aif/data atomic mutation ──► audit + executor history
              │                                  │
              └──────── safe WS snapshots ◄──────┘
```

Every task has `executionOwner`, `ownershipRevision`, and zero or more assignment rows.
`autoMode` remains a separate approval-gate setting. AI-owned tasks follow the legacy
pipeline. Human-owned tasks are excluded at the shared data-query boundary from
coordinator claims, scheduled execution, auto-queue, watchdog recovery, permit waiting,
and runtime-budget consumption.

| Human-owned status    | Assigned participant actions                                            |

| `verify`              | `pass_verification`, `fail_verification`                                |
| `blocked_external`    | `retry_from_blocked`                                                    |
| `done`                | `approve_done`, `request_changes`                                       |
| `verified`            | terminal; no handoff or action                                          |

Handoffs replace owner and assignments in one SQLite transaction. The request must match
the expected ownership revision and may also assert the previous owner/status. A live AI
lease, stale revision, inactive assignee, or invalid resume transition returns a structured
conflict without partial writes. Human → AI at manual `plan_ready` requires
`start_implementation`; at `blocked_external` it requires `retry_from_blocked`.
Executor-history and audit rows snapshot titles, statuses, actors, assignee names/roles,
and active flags so later account edits do not rewrite history.

Ownership is execution policy, not filesystem isolation. A handoff waits for live leases,
but operators must still avoid simultaneous edits to the same project root/worktree.

| `false`        | `true`       | `true`           | `true`          | Planning → Improve → Plan Ready → Implementing → Verify → Done          |

`verify` remains a coordinator stage, not a human action. That keeps it covered by the same claim, timeout, watchdog, runtime-profile, and activity-log machinery as other autonomous work. The semantic contract is narrower than review: verify validates the implementation against the accepted plan, while review/security sidecars evaluate code quality and risk.

### QA Pipeline

Tasks carry a separate QA workflow that runs the `/aif-qa --all` pipeline (change-summary → test-plan → test-cases). It is driven by the API service `packages/api/src/services/qaRunner.ts` (modeled on `commitGeneration.ts` — fire-and-forget, returns a structured `{ ok, error }` result and never throws), which executes the prompt through `runApiRuntimeOneShot` and writes three markdown artifacts to `<paths.qa>/<branch-slug>/` (`change-summary.md`, `test-plan.md`, `test-cases.md`). The artifacts are persisted onto the task (`qaChangeSummary`, `qaTestPlan`, `qaTestCases`) and surfaced in the **QA** tab of the task detail view.

The branch-slug is computed deterministically (`<safe-slug>-<git-hash-object-prefix>`) as a hard contract with `.claude/skills/aif-qa/SKILL.md`, so the runner reads from the same directory the skill writes to. QA runs in the task's worktree root (`worktreePath`) when present, otherwise the project root.

Two trigger paths exist:

- **Manual** — `POST /tasks/:id/run-qa` (available in the UI once the task reaches `done` or `verified`).
- **Automatic** — the `autoQa` flag (default `false`). When `true`, the QA pipeline starts after `approve_done` (`done → verified`).

Progress is reported via `qaStatus` (`idle` → `running` → `done`/`error`) and the `task:qa_started` / `task:qa_done` / `task:qa_failed` WebSocket events.

Concurrent starts are serialized by an atomic DB claim (`tryStartQaRun` — a conditional `UPDATE` to `running`), so a duplicate manual POST or a manual+auto race never spawns two runtime runs. Every failure path releases the claim with a terminal `qaStatus: "error"`, and on API startup any task left in `running` (e.g. a crash or restart mid-run) is reset to `error` (`resetStaleQaRuns`) so a stuck claim can never block future QA starts.

### Pause / Resume

Tasks have a `paused` flag (default `false`). When `true`, the coordinator skips the task in all selection queries:

- `findCoordinatorTaskCandidate` — paused tasks are not picked up for any stage (planning, plan-checking, implementing, reviewing).
- `listDueBlockedExternalTasks` — paused blocked tasks are not auto-released when their retry window elapses.
- `listStaleInProgressTasks` — paused tasks are not treated as stale by the watchdog, so they won't be force-recovered to `blocked_external`.

**Important:** pausing a task does **not** abort an already running runtime session. If a query is in flight, it will finish. The pause takes effect on the **next** coordinator cycle — the task simply won't be picked up for the next stage transition.

The Pause/Resume button is shown in the TaskDetail Actions bar for active processing stages (`planning`, `plan_ready`, `implementing`, `review`, `blocked_external`). It is hidden for `backlog`, `done`, and `verified` where the agent pipeline is not running.

### Scheduled Execution

Tasks expose an optional `scheduledAt` column (ISO-8601 UTC, nullable). On every
poll cycle the coordinator calls `processDueScheduledTasks()` which:

1. Lists backlog tasks with `scheduledAt <= now` (paused tasks skipped).
2. Transitions each from `backlog` to `planning` using the same state patch as
   the human `start_ai` event, clearing `scheduledAt` in the same write.
3. Appends a `[scheduler]` entry to the task activity log.
4. Broadcasts `task:scheduled_fired` via WebSocket.

Past timestamps are rejected at the API layer with `400`; `null` clears a
previous schedule. Scheduled firing is one-shot — the task never re-fires
automatically after `scheduledAt` is cleared.

### Auto-Queue Mode

Projects expose an `autoQueueMode` flag (default `false`). When `true`,
`processAutoQueueAdvance()` runs every poll cycle and for each such project
fills the pipeline up to a **pool depth**:

Ordinary task creation is intentionally append-only within a project's backlog:
when `POST /tasks` (or any other default `createTask()` caller) omits an
explicit `position`, the data layer assigns `max(position) + 100` inside that
project's backlog. Auto-queue then consumes the smallest backlog `position`,
which makes ordinary backlog creation FIFO instead of LIFO.

- **Sequential project** (`parallelEnabled = false`): pool depth = `1`. The
  next backlog task fires into `planning` only after the previous one
  reaches a terminal status (`done` / `verified`). "In-flight" is counted by
  pipeline status, not by lock — so transitions between stages do not open a
  window for early advance.
- **Parallel project** (`parallelEnabled = true`): pool depth =
  `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS_PER_PROJECT`. Auto-queue keeps that many tasks in
  flight, advancing as soon as room frees up. For projects with
  `git.create_branches=true`, this parallel branch-isolated path is available
  only when `AIF_TASK_WORKTREES_ENABLED=true`; otherwise the project remains
  serial and the API rejects parallel auto-queue for that combination.
  When enabled, full-mode planning creates a sibling git worktree, stores its
  absolute path in `tasks.worktree_path`, and downstream stages run from that
  path. Legacy branch-bound tasks without `worktreePath` still force serial
  execution until they leave the pipeline.
  When `AIF_AGENT_AUTO_QUEUE_COMMIT_GATE_ENABLED=true`, Git-backed auto-queue
  projects that do not provide isolated task worktrees are also forced to pool
  depth `1`, even when `parallelEnabled=true`, because task-scoped commits
  cannot safely share one working directory. Non-auto-queue projects retain
  their existing concurrency behavior.

The advance step:

1. Compute `limit = parallelEnabled ? COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS_PER_PROJECT : 1`,
   then collapse it to `1` when branch isolation would use the shared project
   root.
2. Read `active = countActivePipelineTasksForProject(project)` — counts tasks
   in `planning`, `plan_ready`, `implementing`, `review`, or `blocked_external`.
   Backlog (source) and `done`/`verified` (terminal) do not count.
3. While `active < limit`, pick the next backlog task by ascending `position`
   (skipping paused tasks and tasks with future `scheduledAt`), fire it into
   `planning`, append an `[auto-queue]` activity-log entry, and broadcast
   `project:auto_queue_advanced` with the new task id.
4. The fill loop runs in a single tick so a parallel project can start its
   full pool without waiting for additional poll cycles.

When `AIF_AGENT_AUTO_QUEUE_COMMIT_GATE_ENABLED=true`, the coordinator runs a
synchronous commit gate in an auto-queued task's project root or isolated
worktree before publishing the task as `done`:

1. The backlog claim atomically stores the task's starting Git `HEAD` and marks
   its commit state `pending`.
2. A dirty worktree invokes the existing `/aif-commit` workflow with push
   disabled. The coordinator then verifies that the worktree is clean, `HEAD`
   changed, the expected branch is still checked out, and exactly one commit
   was created by the commit run.
3. A clean worktree is recorded as `no_changes`, unless `HEAD` already differs
   from the stored baseline (for example, the implementer committed directly);
   in that case the current SHA is recorded as `committed`.
4. The verified SHA is stored in `tasks.commit_sha` before the status changes
   to `done`. A commit failure moves the task to `blocked_external`, so it still
   counts as in flight and the next backlog task cannot start.
5. After a restart, a clean `HEAD` that differs from the stored baseline is
   reconciled without creating a duplicate commit. Terminal tasks with an
   unresolved commit state defensively pause project advancement.

The flag defaults to `false`. In that state, terminal transitions and project
concurrency follow the legacy path and no auto-queue commit state is prepared.

Task worktrees are retained after `done` / `verified` so operators can inspect
follow-up changes. Handoff records the path but does not automatically remove
the sibling worktree directory.

Auto-queue and scheduled execution compose in the same poll cycle:
`processDueScheduledTasks()` runs first and fires every eligible backlog task
whose `scheduledAt` is due, then `processAutoQueueAdvance()` runs and **tops up
the remaining pool slots**. With the completion-commit flag enabled, a due
auto-queue task remains scheduled/backlogged while its Git worktree is dirty,
preventing unrelated pre-existing changes from entering the task's commit.
Order matters because once the scheduler advances a task, it counts as
in-flight and reduces how many slots auto-queue still needs to fill. Both
passes use the same atomic `claimBacklogTaskForAdvance` write so a row is moved
out of `backlog` exactly once even when both passes target the same task in the
same cycle.

## Roadmap Import

The system supports bulk task creation from a project's `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` file via `POST /projects/:id/roadmap/import`.

**Flow:**

1. API reads `ROADMAP.md` from the project root
2. Agent SDK (haiku model) converts markdown milestones into structured JSON
3. Response is validated via zod schema
4. Tasks are created in batch with deduplication (by `projectId + normalizedTitle + roadmapAlias`)
5. Each task receives automatic tags: `roadmap`, `rm:<alias>`, `phase:<N>`, `phase:<name>`, `seq:<NN>`
6. WebSocket broadcasts `task:created` per task and `agent:wake` after batch

**Deduplication:** Re-running import with the same alias is safe — existing tasks with matching titles are skipped. This makes the endpoint idempotent for reruns.

**Ordering semantics:** Roadmap import is the explicit front-of-queue path.
Imported tasks receive explicit backlog positions ahead of the current backlog
minimum so phase/sequence order wins even though ordinary task creation now
appends to the backlog tail. This ordering is intentional and separate from the
default `POST /tasks` behavior.

**Legacy data:** Existing backlog rows are not rewritten automatically during
deploy because operators can manually reorder backlog positions. If legacy rows
still reflect old LIFO-era positions, use the opt-in normalization utility
documented in `docs/configuration.md`.

**Tag taxonomy:** Tags enable UI filtering. The `roadmap` quick filter in the Board shows only roadmap-generated tasks. When the roadmap filter is active, a sub-filter row displays all available `roadmapAlias` values (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.0`) as clickable chips, allowing users to narrow results to a specific roadmap. Selecting no alias shows all roadmap tasks; selecting one or more aliases filters to only those. Tags like `phase:backend` allow additional grouping refinements.

**Logging:** Import logs at INFO level for start/finish with counts, DEBUG for per-task decisions, and ERROR for parse/validation failures. Check API logs during failures by filtering for the `roadmap-generation` component.

## Real-Time Updates

The API broadcasts events via WebSocket (`/ws` endpoint) on every state change:

| Event                           | Trigger                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `task:created`                  | New task created                                      |
| `task:updated`                  | Task fields updated                                   |
| `task:moved`                    | Task status changed via state machine                 |
| `task:deleted`                  | Task deleted                                          |
| `task:qa_started`               | QA pipeline started (manual run-qa or auto-trigger)   |
| `task:qa_done`                  | QA pipeline finished successfully                     |
| `task:qa_failed`                | QA pipeline failed                                    |
| `agent:wake`                    | Coordinator should check for work                     |
| `task:heartbeat`                | Running task renewed its liveness (every 30s)         |
| `task:usage_updated`            | Task-scoped token/cost usage recorded at run boundary |
| `project:runtime_limit_updated` | Runtime-profile limit snapshot persisted or cleared   |

The web UI connects via `useWebSocket` hook and invalidates React Query caches on incoming events. The agent coordinator also subscribes to this WebSocket to receive wake signals for immediate task processing (see Agent Pipeline above).

`task:heartbeat` and `task:usage_updated` use targeted cache updates instead of full-board refetches: heartbeat patches the cached task/list `lastHeartbeatAt`, and usage updates refresh only the open `["task", id]` query (plus a `task:usage_updated` DOM event for the detail-header indicator).

### Activity Logging

Agent tool events are tracked in each task's `agentActivityLog` field. Two modes are supported (configured via `ACTIVITY_LOG_MODE`):

- **sync** (default): Each event writes immediately to the database.
- **batch**: Events are buffered in an in-memory queue per task and flushed when the batch size, max age timer, or stage boundary is reached. Shutdown handlers ensure buffered entries are persisted on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

## Task Read Models

The API separates task list reads from task detail reads to keep project board
loads bounded:

- `GET /tasks?projectId=<uuid>` requires a project id and returns lightweight
  `TaskListItem` rows from `listTaskListItems(projectId)`.
- `TaskListItem` includes board, list, filtering, command-palette, runtime-limit,
  and metric fields plus the derived `hasPlan` flag.
- `TaskListItem` intentionally excludes heavy detail-only fields: attachments,
  plan text, implementation log, review comments, agent activity log, runtime
  options, auto-review state, and QA markdown artifacts.
- `GET /tasks/:id` remains the full task detail endpoint for task detail, chat,
  comments, and agent workflows.
- `GET /projects/overview` uses `listProjectTaskOverviews()` to serve compact
  per-project counts, metric totals, and small title previews without loading
  every task row into the web client.

## Database

SQLite via `better-sqlite3` with `drizzle-orm` for type-safe queries. Schema is defined in `packages/shared/src/schema.ts`, and all DB reads/writes are executed through `packages/data/src/index.ts`.

Key tables:

- **tasks** — task data, status, plan/logs, heartbeat metadata, runtime override fields (`runtime_profile_id`, `model_override`, `runtime_options_json`), runtime session id (`session_id`), internal stage-scoped runtime retry pin (`active_runtime_status`, `active_runtime_selection_json`), auto-review convergence state (`manual_review_required`, `auto_review_state_json`), and task-level runtime-limit copy (`runtime_limit_snapshot_json`, `runtime_limit_updated_at`). The active runtime fields are distinct from `session_id` and `runtime_limit_snapshot_json`; they store the runtime/profile/model/options selected for same-status retries and are cleared on stage or human transitions except `retry_from_blocked`.
- **github_repositories** — one non-secret repository connection and eligibility policy per project
- **github_issues** — idempotent project/issue-to-task mapping plus PR, checks, and review state
- **gitlab_repositories** — one non-secret GitLab repository connection and eligibility policy per project
- **gitlab_issues** — idempotent project/iid-to-task mapping plus MR, checks, and approvals-only review state
- **runtime_profiles** — project-scoped or global runtime/provider profiles with non-secret transport/model config plus authoritative runtime-limit state (`runtime_limit_snapshot_json`, `runtime_limit_updated_at`)
- **projects** — project metadata plus default runtime profile ids for tasks and chat
- **chat_sessions / chat_messages** — persisted chat state with runtime profile/session linkage
- **codex_sessions** — indexed Codex session metadata keyed by runtime session id and source file state
- **codex_limit_heads / codex_limit_history** — latest and recent normalized Codex limit snapshots keyed by account fingerprint/project scope/limit id
- **codex_index_cursors** — per-indexer progress/watermark state for incremental reconcile
- **task_comments** — human/agent comments with optional attachments

### Indexes

Runtime index bootstrap creates the following indexes via `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` at startup:

- `idx_tasks_status` — coordinator stage filtering
- `idx_tasks_retry_after` — blocked-task retry scans
- `idx_tasks_project_id` — project-scoped task lists
- `idx_tasks_status_retry` — composite for coordinator retry queries
- `idx_tasks_project_status` — composite for ordered task-list queries
- `idx_task_comments_task_id` — comment lookups by task
- `idx_tasks_locked` — parallel execution: find unlocked or stale-locked tasks
- `idx_codex_sessions_project_root_updated` / `idx_codex_sessions_file_path` — local Codex session listing and session-id/file-path lookup
- `idx_codex_limit_heads_lookup` — account/project/limit scoped head overlay queries
- `idx_codex_limit_history_head` / `idx_codex_limit_history_account` — bounded recent limit history by head and account scope
